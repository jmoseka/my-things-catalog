### Team member #2
- Create MusicAlbum class in a separate .rb file :topic 
- Create Genre class with an association to the Item class (in a separate .rb file).
- All MusicAlbum class properties visible in the diagram should be defined and set up in the constructor method.
- All Genre class properties visible in the diagram should be defined and set up in the constructor method.
- Implement methods:
    - add_item method in the Genre class
        - should take an instance of the Item class as an input
        - should add the input item to the collection of items
        - should add self as a property of the item object (by using the correct setter from the item object)
    - can_be_archived?() in the MusicAlbum class
        - should override the method from the parent class
        - should return true if parent's method returns true AND if on_spotify equals true
        - otherwise, it should return false
 - Add unit tests for all implemented methods.
 - The following options should be available:
    - List all music albums
    - List all genres (e.g 'Comedy', 'Thriller')
    - Add a music album
 - All data should be preserved by saving collections in .json files.
 - Create a schema.sql file with tables that will be analogical to the structure of the classes that you created:
    - music_albums table (add all properties and associations from the parent Item class as table columns)
    - genres table
